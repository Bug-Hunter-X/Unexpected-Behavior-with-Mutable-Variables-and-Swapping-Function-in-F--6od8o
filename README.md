This example demonstrates a common error when working with mutable variables in F#.  The `swap` function attempts to exchange the values of `x` and `y`, but due to F#'s immutability by default, only copies of the input are modified, leaving the original variables unchanged. The solution involves using mutable references to directly modify the original variables.
